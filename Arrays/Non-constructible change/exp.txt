Lets say our constructible_change is 7, it basically means that with our current coins, we can make from 1,2,3,...,7.

Now, we already have a fact, that we can make any coin from 1 to 7, right?
Then, whatever coin (n) we add to it, we will be able to make n+1, n+2, n+3, ... n+7.

Now, the reason why n must be less than constructible_change + 1 for us to add it to our minimum change is that: 

If n is greater than constructible_change+1, then we can't make constructible_change+1 with our coins.

For example, our new coin is 9. We can make 9+1, 9+2, ..., 9+7, but we can't make 8.
To make 8 we need any coin less than or equal to 8. 

If we have 8 we can just use that coin. If we have 7 we can add 1 to it. If we have 6 we can add 2 to it, and so on.
